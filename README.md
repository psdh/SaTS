# SaTS: Shapes as Time Series

### Work Plan:
Implement Clustering with Complexity-invariant distance measure (check [paper](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/Complexity-Invariant%20Distance%20Measure.pdf))  on the swedish leaf data set.

### Dataset:
We are using the swedish leaf dataset. Here is a [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00288/leaf.zip) to the original data set (images). We are using a modified version wherein the images have been converted to a time series (read above-mentioned paper). Its in this [archive](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/UCR_TS_Archive_2015.zip)
